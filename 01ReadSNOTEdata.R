#asking R to read the date as a date;

#calculating annual snow totals

#defining the wateryear and waterdate
waterdate=rDate+90

#simple plots
barplot(tapply(SNOWnwt$SWE_in,wateryear,max))
plot(snowsum,snowpeaks)

#quick plot showing how cummulative SWE for the year and water year differ
plot(snowsum_ann,prec_acc)


#TO DO: I've made a mess and made a lot of variables in the global environment  merge new data vectors to SNOWnwt and store for later use
